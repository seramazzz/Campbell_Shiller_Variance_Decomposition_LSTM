# Campbell-Shiller-Variance-Decomposition-LSTM
I propose a multi-layer LSTM model with the intuition based on findings of Campbell and Shiller (1988) and Campbell (1991). With the flexibility of the LSTM and the theoretical facts about returns and volatility, I am able to predict one day ahead realised volatility of S&amp;P 500, beating GARCH and HAR benchmark.
